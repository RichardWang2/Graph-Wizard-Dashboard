# Welcome to my Data Science Dashboard

During my undergraduate data science courses, when I was writing Python code to deploy different plots, I realized that a lot of code is repetitive. Over some time if I forget about plots I would also have to go back and check the usage and documentation of different plots. So I thought, why not build an app that allows me to upload a dataset, and it’ll generate graphs on its own! This is how I got the inspiration to build “Graph Wizard”. (Not a lot of time went into the naming, apologies.) 
<br><br>
So during summer of 2023, I start building a web application that takes a user input dataset, and automatically generate plots based on the data. Although I’m not an expert in web development, I discovered a platform called streamlit that does many of the web development in the background, and makes it easy for data people (like myself) do build data applications!
<br><br>
After knowing what I want to build, I started browsing through streamlit documentations and discovered a bunch of cool looking UI designs. I definitely wasted too much time playing around with fancy animations… The app is still in development, as I soon started school and got busy :( The app can do some basic plotting, like line plots, scatter plots, histograms, barcharts, etc. I am currently working on automatic suggestions on which kind of plot the user should use.

Thank you for checking out Graph Wizard, and I hope you enjoy playing around with it!
